## Global Variables

- `LotSize`: The default lot size for each trade.
- `GridSize`: The size of the grid used in the grid trading strategy.

## Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is called during the expert initialization. It initializes necessary components and settings. In this code, it simply prints a message indicating successful initialization.

## Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is called during the expert deinitialization. It performs necessary cleanup tasks. In this code, it prints a message indicating successful deinitialization.

## Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick. It implements the grid-based approach for currency trading by calling the `GridTrading()` function. It also performs other trading operations and risk management.

## Grid Trading Function

The `GridTrading()` function is responsible for implementing the unique grid strategy based on market conditions. It retrieves the current and previous prices, checks if the market is trending or ranging, and executes the corresponding trading strategy. It also adjusts the grid size and lot size based on market conditions. Finally, it manages risk and updates trading preferences.

## Market Trending Check

The `IsTrendingMarket()` function determines if the market is trending or ranging based on the price movement. It calculates the price difference between the current and previous prices and compares it to a threshold. If the absolute value of the price difference is greater than 0.0001, it returns true indicating a trending market; otherwise, it returns false indicating a ranging market.

## Risk Management

The `ManageRisk()` function is responsible for implementing advanced risk management features. It can be customized to suit specific risk preferences and trading strategies.

## Update Preferences

The `UpdatePreferences()` function is responsible for updating user-defined preferences, risk parameters, and performance targets. It can be used to adjust trading settings dynamically based on market conditions or other factors.

## Testing Function

The `OnTester()` function is called during expert testing. It performs necessary testing procedures. This section can be customized to include specific testing scenarios and analysis.

## Program Entry and Conclusion

The `OnStart()` function is the program entry point. It calls the `OnTick()` function to start the trading robot.

The `OnStop()` function is called when the program is stopped. It performs necessary cleanup tasks and stops the trading robot.
